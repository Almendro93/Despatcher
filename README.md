# Dispatcher

This code defines a StarkNet contract called IERC20Dispatcher that implements the IERC20DispatcherTrait trait. Let's break down the main components:

trait IERC20DispatcherTrait<T>: This trait defines two functions:

name(self: T) -> felt252: This function is expected to retrieve the name of the ERC-20 token. The return type is felt252, which is likely a specific type used in the StarkNet environment.
transfer(self: T, recipient: ContractAddress, amount: u256): This function is meant to transfer a certain amount of the ERC-20 token to a specified recipient, identified by their ContractAddress.
#[derive(Copy, Drop, starknet::Store, Serde)] struct IERC20Dispatcher: This struct represents the state of the IERC20Dispatcher contract. It has a single field contract_address of type ContractAddress.

impl IERC20DispatcherImpl of IERC20DispatcherTrait<IERC20Dispatcher>: This implementation block associates the IERC20DispatcherTrait trait with the IERC20Dispatcher struct. It provides implementations for the trait's functions:

fn name(self: IERC20Dispatcher) -> felt252: This function appears to use starknet::call_contract_syscall internally to interact with the StarkNet system and retrieve the name of the ERC-20 token.
fn transfer(self: IERC20Dispatcher, recipient: ContractAddress, amount: u256): Similar to the name function, this one seems to use starknet::call_contract_syscall to handle the transfer of the ERC-20 token.
Overall, this contract is a dispatcher for ERC-20 token-related operations. It likely serves as an abstraction layer for interacting with ERC-20 tokens on the StarkNet platform. The actual logic for interacting with the StarkNet system and performing token operations is implemented in the functions using starknet::call_contract_syscall.
